# Distribution

## Package layout

`npm pack` publishes exactly:

```
package.json      main → src/host/index.js, exports ./client, ./cordis.patch.yml
src/              host + shared modules (plain ESM, no build step)
lib/client.js     the built browser bundle (committed)
cordis.patch.yml  bundle patch
README.md  CHANGELOG.md  LICENSE
```

`docs/`, `test/`, and `scripts/` stay in the repository; `files` keeps them out of
the tarball. `lib/` is in `.gitignore` for the *rest* of the directory but
`lib/client.js` is committed, because the registry install must work without
running a build. CI enforces freshness: it rebuilds and fails if the committed
bundle differs.

## Why the browser bundle is committed

A DSH profile installs packages into `~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/` and loads the
client entry listed in `dsh.client`. Running esbuild at install time would require
a devDependency in a production install; committing the bundle keeps the install
to a plain extract, exactly like the harness's own client packages.

The package therefore declares **no install-time script**. That is deliberate:

- pnpm blocks `prepare` on git-hosted packages unless the package is added to the
  profile's `onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist, which would turn the documented
  one-line `dsh plugin add github:…` into a two-step install;
- a plugin that others install should not execute code at install time when the
  artifact it would produce is already committed.

`prepack` still rebuilds the bundle for `npm pack` / `npm publish`, and
`npm run build` is the local development path.

## Installation paths

| Path | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | `dsh plugin add github:vitas/dsh-web-search-openrouter --profile web` | Tracks the default branch. Applies the same bundle patch at the next boot; no install-time script, so no pnpm allowlist entry is needed. |
| Registry (recommended) | `dsh plugin add @samebits/dsh-web-search-openrouter --profile web` | Published; same bundle patch. |
| Linked checkout | `dsh plugin add link:$PWD --profile web` | Run `npm install && npm run build` first. |

Both paths compose the web seam and the provider row from
[`cordis.patch.yml`](../cordis.patch.yml). The profile's own
`cordis.patch.yml` is applied **after** bundle patches and wins per row, so a
deployment can override any value (and address the same `web-search-openrouter`
row) without forking the package.

> A patch replaces the target row's **whole** `config`, so an override must
> restate every field it wants to keep. The `web` row carries exactly
> `searchProvider` and `fetchProvider`.

## Profile wiring, spelled out

The bundle patch is equivalent to:

```yaml
- id: web
  config:
    searchProvider: openrouter
    fetchProvider: http

- insert:
    - id: web-search-openrouter
      name: '@samebits/dsh-web-search-openrouter'
      config:
        protocol: openai
        apiKeyEnv: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
        baseURL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
        model: openai/gpt-5.2
```

Do **not** also add this `insert` to the profile's own patch: two rows with the
same id would register two providers with the same id. If you wired the plugin
manually before 1.0.0, delete those rows when you switch to the bundled install.

## Release checklist

```sh
npm ci
npm run check          # syntax + typecheck
npm run check-locales
npm test               # 34 offline tests (the live one self-skips)
DSH_WEB_SEARCH_LIVE=1 OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… \
  DSH_WEB_SEARCH_BASE_URL=… DSH_WEB_SEARCH_MODEL=… \
  node --test test/live.test.mjs
npm run build          # and commit lib/client.js
npm pack --dry-run     # confirm the file set
```

Then: bump `version` in `package.json`, move the CHANGELOG's unreleased section
into the new version, commit, and publish.

## Publishing

Two paths, both guarded by the same pre-flight:

- **Locally** — `npm publish` (the package is scoped, so it needs
  `--access public`, which `publishConfig.access` now supplies).
- **From CI** — the [`publish`](../.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow.
  `workflow_dispatch` packs by default; set `dry_run: false`, or publish a GitHub
  release, to upload. It re-runs the checks, rebuilds the bundle, and **fails if
  the committed `lib/client.js` differs from the rebuild**, so the tarball can
  never ship a browser half that is not the one under review. It uploads with
  `--provenance`.

Auth for the CI path is either an npm **Automation** token stored as the
repository secret `NPM_TOKEN` (automation tokens bypass the account's 2FA prompt,
which interactive `npm login` cannot do from a runner), or npm **trusted
publishing**: register this repository as a trusted publisher for the package on
npmjs.com and drop the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` line — npm then authenticates with the
run's OIDC identity and no secret is stored at all.

## Versioning

Semantic versioning against the plugin's own surfaces:

- **major** — a renamed or removed config field, provider `id`, settings
  namespace, or loopback route; a raised minimum DSH version.
- **minor** — a new protocol, field, route, or locale.
- **patch** — parsing fixes, message improvements, dependency bumps.
